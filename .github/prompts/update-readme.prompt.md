# Update README

Prepare and apply README documentation changes for recently added or modified functionality.

## Steps

1. Read `README.md` and understand its structure.
2. Identify sections impacted by recent changes (commands, options, features).
3. For new commands, add a section under Commands with:
   - Command header
   - Brief description
   - Usage block
   - Arguments list
   - Options list
4. For modified commands, update description, usage, arguments, and options as needed.
5. Create an `implementation_plan.md` describing the proposed README changes.
6. Request review/approval for the plan.
7. Apply approved changes to `README.md`.
